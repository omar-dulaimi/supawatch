### Patch Changes

- e3a62a0: A second, harsher torture round (multi-level partitioning, foreign
  tables, zero-column and 120-column tables, hostile identifiers, an
  unpopulated materialized view, FK exotics) found and fixed another
  batch:

  - Zero-column tables were invisible (the snapshot was built from column
    rows alone); foreign tables (FDW) were invisible too. Both now appear:
    foreign tables carry the new kind "foreign" and every writable code
    path treats them as read-only; the Database bridge lists them beside
    plain tables and pgtap asserts them with has_foreign_table.
  - An unpopulated materialized view or a failing foreign-table read
    aborted the whole generate run mid-verification; both now verify as
    skipped with a note.
  - A column literally named **proto** silently corrupted every generated
    schema (object literals set the prototype even for quoted keys) until
    a validator crashed; generation now refuses it loudly. A table named
    "index" silently lost its schema file to the barrel; that is now a
    loud error too.
  - Seed correctness: nullable foreign keys now order parents before
    children (soft edges, broken only on real cycles with those cells
    seeded null); FKs referencing a UNIQUE column instead of the primary
    key are refused with a named reason; free-text placeholders are only
    emitted for genuinely free-text base types (inet, cidr, interval and
    friends have constrained input syntax) and respect varchar/char
    length caps.
  - Trigger-returning functions no longer leak into the Functions block;
    dictionary cells escape pipes and newlines in comments; the schema
    card keeps multiline comments on one line. SUPAWATCH_DEBUG=1 prints
    stack traces on CLI errors.

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- d0f303b: Two fixes found by inspecting real generated output. The pgtap suite
  asserted RLS through `tests.rls_enabled`, a Supabase test-helpers
  function that does not exist in core pgtap, contradicting the file's own
  "run with pg_prove" claim; it now asserts straight off `pg_class` with
  core `ok()`, so the suite runs under plain pg_prove and supabase test db
  alike. The schema card labeled every temporal column `date` because both
  `date` and `timestamptz` arrive as JS Date at runtime; an LLM reading
  "date" plans calendar arithmetic, so temporal columns now keep their SQL
  granularity (`date`, `timestamp`, `timestamptz`).

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [9314a4a]
  - @supawatch/core@0.7.0

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 0fbe207: Eight new targets: effect (Effect Schema structs, verified as a fifth
  parity verdict), rest (Hono route modules), service (typed repositories
  over postgres.js), orpc (oRPC routers), graphql (an executable Pothos
  schema), pgtap (a plan-counted structural test suite), rls (policy
  skeletons for exactly the tables that need attention), and pgmq (typed
  queue clients per detected queue).

  Core grows an RLS facet: tables now carry `rlsEnabled` and their
  `pg_policies` rows, and the watcher diff reports RLS enables, disables,
  policy creates, and policy drops as they happen.
