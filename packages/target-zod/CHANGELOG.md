# @supawatch/target-zod

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- e650db3: Proper npm pages: every package now ships a focused README, a
  description, and keywords. No code changes.
- Updated dependencies [e650db3]
  - @supawatch/core@0.1.3

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- bc8f8bf: Two fixes found by dogfooding the published packages in a fresh consumer
  project. The barrel now ships an index.d.mts beside index.mjs, because a
  strict TypeScript consumer cannot type barrel imports without it. And
  DATABASE_URL falls back to a minimal ./.env read (flat file, no
  expansion) when the variable is not exported, which is how real projects
  keep it.
- Updated dependencies [bc8f8bf]
  - @supawatch/core@0.1.2

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- First complete release. The 0.1.0 versions of supawatch, core, target-zod
  and watch were published from a stale phase-1 checkout and predate waves 1
  through 5; 0.1.1 is the first version carrying the full feature set: four
  validator targets plus the Database bridge, both measured driver profiles,
  arrays and the extended scalar map, variants, barrels, jsonTypes, and the
  release scaffolding.
- Updated dependencies
  - @supawatch/core@0.1.1
